It\\'s grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It\\'s not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

(This #10DatesIn10Days is mostly for fun, but we are all secretly hoping she finds her BOO!) You\\'ll meet Kohl today, after meeting Ethan and Jorge last week. You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she\\'ll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya\\'ll (along with her) help choose!‚úÖ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com Our friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy\\'s partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! Alyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w Betsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw When Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we\\'ve all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)The idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her 10 Dates in 10 Days and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you\\'ll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!Each boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN and planned great date ideas! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) Kohl did a great job planning his date with a few super fun activities! Indoor skydiving, painting, and ice cream. Is this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She\\'s been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*If this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???This video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.

The moment of the massive explosion that rocked the Lebanese capital Beirut, killing more than 137 people and injuring thousands, was captured in high definition by a shop owner who was recording when the blast hit.Video shows smoke rising from Beirut\\'s port with small sparks being seen in what is believed to be fireworks that were set off by the blaze. According to reports, fireworks were stored in the same warehouse where 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate had previously been stored. After several seconds of recording, a massive explosion bursts outwards, which then moves outwards towards where the shop owner is, the resulting shockwave impacting multiple buildings in the process.For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/7256905/beirut-explosion-map-canada-cities/',\n",

And thanks to his expected brilliance, Messi\\'s side advanced to the quarterfinals. A trio of first-half goals gave the La Liga side a 3-1 win over their opponent, providing a 4-2 aggregate win that saw Barcelona through to the final eight.Lionel Messi, who had a lot on the line entering, scored a fantastic goal in the first half to help build an early 3-1 halftime advantage against their Serie A opposition. Luis Suarez and Clement Lenglet also contributed to the lead with goals of their own, while all Napoli was able to respond with was a penalty from Lorenzo Insigne.

Bayern Munich won the second leg, 4-1, with Robert Lewandowski scoring twice. The Bundesliga winners came into the second leg with a 3-0 advantage, so they ended up with a 7-1 aggregate edge over their Premier League opponent.The German side was able to capitalize on their first leg momentum early as Lewandowski, the competition\\'s leading score, earned a penalty kick in the 10th minute and converted the attempt. Bayern added goals throughout with Ivan Perisic scoring in the 24th minute, and Corentin Tolisso adding to the scoreline fresh off the bench during the 76th minute. Lewandowski headed home the 13th goal of his Champions League campaign in the 84th minute.

Starring Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield.  Only in theaters 2021.  ‚ÄúYou can murder a revolutionary, but you can‚Äôt murder a revolution.https://twitter.com/wbpictureshttps://www.instagram.com/wbpictures https://www.facebook.com/WarnerBrosPictures/Chairman Fred Hampton was 21 years old when he was assassinated by the FBI, who coerced a petty criminal named William O‚ÄôNeal to help them silence him and the Black Panther Party.  But they could not kill Fred Hampton‚Äôs legacy and, 50 years later, his words still echo‚Ä¶louder than ever. I am a revolutionary!         In 1968, a young, charismatic activist named Fred Hampton became Chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party, who were fighting for freedom, the power to determine the destiny of the Black community, and an end to police brutality and the slaughter of Black people.Chairman Fred was inspiring a generation to rise up and not back down to oppression, which put him directly in the line of fire of the government, the FBI and the Chicago Police.  But to destroy the revolution, they had to do it from both the outside‚Ä¶and the inside.  Facing prison, William O‚ÄôNeal is offered a deal by the FBI: if he will infiltrate the Black Panthers and provide intel on Hampton, he will walk free.  O‚ÄôNeal takes the deal.         Now a comrade in arms in the Black Panther Party, O‚ÄôNeal lives in fear that his treachery will be discovered even as he rises in the ranks.  But as Hampton‚Äôs fiery message draws him in, O‚ÄôNeal cannot escape the deadly trajectory of his ultimate betrayal.         Though his life was cut short, Fred Hampton‚Äôs impact has continued to reverberate.  The government saw the Black Panthers as a militant threat to the status quo and sold that lie to a frightened public in a time of growing civil unrest.  But the perception of the Panthers was not reality.  In inner cities across America, they were providing free breakfasts for children, legal services, medical clinics and research into sickle cell anemia, and political education.

It\\'s grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It\\'s not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

The moment of the massive explosion that rocked the Lebanese capital Beirut, killing more than 137 people and injuring thousands, was captured in high definition by a shop owner who was recording when the blast hit.Video shows smoke rising from Beirut\\'s port with small sparks being seen in what is believed to be fireworks that were set off by the blaze. According to reports, fireworks were stored in the same warehouse where 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate had previously been stored. After several seconds of recording, a massive explosion bursts outwards, which then moves outwards towards where the shop owner is, the resulting shockwave impacting multiple buildings in the process.For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/7256905/beirut-explosion-map-canada-cities/',\n",

(This #10DatesIn10Days is mostly for fun, but we are all secretly hoping she finds her BOO!) You\\'ll meet Kohl today, after meeting Ethan and Jorge last week. You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she\\'ll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya\\'ll (along with her) help choose!‚úÖ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com Our friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy\\'s partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! Alyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w Betsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw When Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we\\'ve all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)The idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her 10 Dates in 10 Days and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you\\'ll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!Each boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN and planned great date ideas! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) Kohl did a great job planning his date with a few super fun activities! Indoor skydiving, painting, and ice cream. Is this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She\\'s been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*If this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???This video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.
