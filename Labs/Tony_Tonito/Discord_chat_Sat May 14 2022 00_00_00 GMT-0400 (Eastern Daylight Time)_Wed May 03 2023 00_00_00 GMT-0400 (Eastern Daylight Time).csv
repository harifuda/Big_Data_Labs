So to explain what I believe without big detail.

Engel, marx and lenin believe the state is an external being to the people, therefore, if people directly form the government, it is enforcement by culture.

But how do you enact this with millions of people? You don't, you hyper-decentralize the country into multiple collective.

Marx believe an external threat like the state and other country need to be constantly checked. Therefore, marx, engel and lenin were pro gun absolutist. So am I. It is in our belief that not only the people should be armed, it should be a duty for people to overthrow a state that try to remove such right. To a libertarian socialist, owning a literal bazooka is ethical. Exemple, many libertarian socialist, including me, believe that the public execution of Ocasio cortez and her lapdogs squad is absolutely ethical. Especially since she approved of an actual dictator in Venezuela and said we should imitate it.

Is the confusion cleared or do I delve further?
